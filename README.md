# Server Restarter

Please do not attempt to change anything in this, or you may break it.

Just run the bat file.

## Requirements

1. Python 3.11 or newer
   - Important: depending on your system and how python is installed or if your python uses an alias you may need to edit the batch file to "py" or "python3"
2. This should work for any world of warcraft core that uses authserver.exe/worldserver.exe
   - This will also work for linux and macOS you need to change the ext argument in server objs

## Setup

To get this up and running git clone in your world of warcraft server's root folder. Navigate to the ServerRestarter
folder and run the bat file. Linux will need a shell file to run without manually running each worldserver.py and 
authserver.py (It's not that important to have a batch/shell script to launch.)
